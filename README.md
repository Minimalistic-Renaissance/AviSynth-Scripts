Scripts used during my encoding days ....

Well basically a collection of some(like less than 2%) of my AviSynth script files which i wrote to encode :
-Blurays
-DVDs
-MVIDs
-Primary Rips

Using MeGUI as a primary encoding tool (frontend)...

Using the x264 encoder :

These were a long time ago about 4 years when i was a Ripper/Moderator @ DCT,BWT,ICT,DT ... 

I still remember most of the concepts if anyone has curiosity ;) ...
